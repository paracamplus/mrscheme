# MrScheme

MrScheme is an interpreter, written in javascript, of a didactic
subset of the Scheme programming language. This interpreter was
written by
[Frédéric Peschanski](https://www-apr.lip6.fr/~pesch/HomePage/homepage.html)
for an introductory course on recursion. 

This interpreter was subsequently used by the
[MOOC programmation récursive](https://programmation-recursive.net/)
in French. See for instance
[MrScheme sandbox](https://programmation-recursive-2.appspot.com/assets/mrscheme/index.html).

This NPM package contains a version of the original MrScheme
now packaged as a module.
